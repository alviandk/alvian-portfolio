Launching a backend application swiftly and securely is a top priority for developers. AWS Elastic Beanstalk stands as an exceptional deployment solution that streamlines the process, enabling quick and hassle-free app deployment. In this blog post, we'll explore how you can rapidly deploy your backend app using AWS Elastic Beanstalk while hosting the domain on Namecheap. This powerful combination ensures both efficient deployment and reliable domain management, offering a seamless user experience.

  

### Why AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

  

1.  **Swift Provisioning and Deployment**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk abstracts away the complexities of infrastructure management, enabling developers to focus solely on their application code. With a few simple steps, you can deploy your app to AWS, and Elastic Beanstalk takes care of provisioning resources like servers, load balancers, and auto-scaling groups. This reduces the time required for setup, ensuring your backend app is ready to launch in no time.

2.  **Ease of Use**: Elastic Beanstalk's user-friendly interface and CLI make it accessible to developers of all levels. Whether you're an AWS expert or new to cloud deployments, Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the process. It supports multiple programming languages, allowing you to deploy applications in your preferred language without any hassle.

3.  **Seamless Integration with AWS Services**: Being part of the AWS ecosystem, Elastic Beanstalk seamlessly integrates with various AWS services. This integration unlocks numerous possibilities for your backend app, empowering you to leverage services like Amazon RDS for managed databases, Amazon S3 for scalable storage, and Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging. This robust integration streamlines the addition of powerful functionalities to your app with ease.

  

### The Long Term Game

In a long term, AWS Elastic Beanstalk offers additional advantages that greatly enhance the management and scalability of your backend application.
  

1.  **Auto Scaling for Massive Load**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides [built-in auto scaling capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.as.html) that automatically adjust the number of instances running your application based on traffic and load. When traffic increases, Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales out, adding more instances to handle the load. Conversely, during low traffic periods, it scales in, reducing the number of instances to optimize resource utilization and cost-efficiency. Auto scaling ensures your application can handle sudden spikes in traffic without manual intervention, providing a seamless user experience even during peak times.

2.  **Blue-Green Deployment Method**: Elastic Beanstalk supports the [ blue-green deployment method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.CNAMESwap.html), which is a powerful strategy for deploying updates to your application without causing downtime or disruptions. In a blue-green deployment, you have two identical environments running side by side: the "blue" environment, which represents the currently active version of your app, and the "green" environment, which represents the new version. During the deployment, traffic is gradually shifted from the blue environment to the green environment. If any issues arise, you can quickly roll back to the blue environment. This approach ensures a smooth transition between versions, reducing the risk of downtime and providing a safety net for updates. 

  

### Step-by-Step Deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Namecheap:
  
 1. Set Up SSL for HTTPS: Secure your domain with an SSL certificate. You can use AWS Certificate Manager to provision a free SSL certificate and associate it with your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

	 - Setup Domain Certificate ![Setup Domain Certificate](https://storage.alviandk.com/rapidly-deploy-a-backend-app-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk/setup-certificate-domain.png)
	 -  Get the domain certificate validation values ![Validation Domain Certificate Values](https://storage.alviandk.com/rapidly-deploy-a-backend-app-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk/validate-domain-certificate.png)
	 - Config the certificate validation values on Namecheap Subdomain setting ![Namecheap Domain Certificate Setup](https://storage.alviandk.com/rapidly-deploy-a-backend-app-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk/validate-certificate-domain.png)

 2. Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment: Log in to the AWS Management Console, navigate to Elastic Beanstalk, and [create a new environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/GettingStarted.CreateApp.html) for your application. Choose the appropriate platform and upload your application package. ![Create App](https://storage.alviandk.com/rapidly-deploy-a-backend-app-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk/create-environment.png)

 3. Configure Environment Settings: Customize your environment settings, such as instance type, scaling options, and security groups, to meet your app's requirements.

 4. Configure Load Balancer: On Auto Scaling Group, choose Load Balanced option from dropdown. ![Load Balancer](https://storage.alviandk.com/rapidly-deploy-a-backend-app-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk/load-balancer.png)
 Then, select Application Load Balanced and setup HTTPS Listener  port 443 on the load balancer to ensure secure communication with your backend app. ![Application Load Balancer](https://storage.alviandk.com/rapidly-deploy-a-backend-app-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk/app-load-balancer.png)

 5. Deploy Your Application: Once all configurations are set, deploy your backend app to the Elastic Beanstalk environment.

 6. Pointing Domain on Namecheap: Head to Namecheap, create a CNAME record for the subdomain. For example, if the EB subdomain is: `test-env.xxx-xxxxxx.ap-southeast-3.elasticbeanstalk.com` then we should have a CNAME entry for it.

7. Test and Monitor: After deployment, thoroughly test your application to ensure everything works as expected. Set up monitoring and logging with Amazon CloudWatch to keep track of your app's performance. ![Deployed](https://storage.alviandk.com/rapidly-deploy-a-backend-app-with-aws-elastic-beanstalk/deployed.png)
